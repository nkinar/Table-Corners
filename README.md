# Table Corners

Do you have a glass table where the corners are sharp and need protecting?
This project provides 3D printed corners for that table.  The
table corners can be affixed using
[Therm O Web Zots](https://www.thermowebonline.com/c/crafts-scrapbooking_adhesive-dots-lines).

Edit the table-corners.ipt part file to create a similar part.  The STEP file
can be used to directly create the part on a 3D printer.
